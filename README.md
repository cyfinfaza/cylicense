# CyLicenses
Licenses for your projects.  
## 1:1 - Mine, not yours.  
A license for projects you wish to advertise as your own work, and that you would not like commerical entities to use. Good for end products, such as websites or desktop apps.  
## 1:2 - Mine, for you.
A license for software you wish to be credited for, but in a less in-depth way that permits commercial use. Good for libraries and components of a larger system, that will likely end up as part of other projects.
## 1:3 - Mine, yours, everyone's.
A license that permits all uses of your code, with or without attribution.
## Notes
- All licenses include an "AS IS" statment as found in the MIT license  
- I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. If my licenses fail to help you in legal cases, it is not my problem. These licenses (like the software they are licensing) come with absolutely no warranty, and I will not be responsible for any issues they cause. If you find problems with them, feel free to make a PR.
- You are free to modify these licenses for your own commercial or non-commercial use
